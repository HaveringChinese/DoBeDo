    <h4>This world is increasingly obsessed with comparing people to one another. But you should only compare yourself to who you were yesterday.
        Below are very simple symbols of your Best and Worst selves. They are simple symbols because nothing visual can convey your complexity.</h4>

        <p>Your Best Self is who you would be if you did everything you know you should do. 
        It's not tied to an outcome you can't control like becoming a celebrity, genius inventor, or billionaire. 
        It's simply who you could be if you stopped doing things you know are wrong and instead spent your time doing things you know are right.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Your Worst Self is who you would be if you gave up on doing what you know is right. </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>Every time you do something right, your Best Self wins a victory. As you get better at doing the right things, your Best Self will get stronger.
        Every time you do something wrong, your Worst Self wins a victory. As you get worse at doing the right things, your Worst Self wlil get stronger.</p>
        <p>Here's how it works:</p>
        <br>
        <p>First, take some time to envision your Best Self. What would your health, knowledge, skills, relationships, spiritual life, and purpose be like?
        What would your Best Self do each day? <br>Put answers to these questions in the various parts of your Best Self below.
        <br>Second, envision your Worst Self. What would the areas of your life be like and what would you do as your Worst Self each day?
        <br>Put answers to these questions in the various parts of your Worst Self below.
        <table cellspacing=20>
            <thead>
                <td>Self</td>
                <td>Health</td>
                <td>Knowledge</td>
                <td>Skills</td>
                <td>Relationships</td>
                <td>Spiritual Life</td>
                <td>Purpose</td>
            </thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Best Self</td>
                <td>Strong and Fit Looking</td>
                <td>Broad strokes of world history and a foreign language</td>
                <td>Automobile Repair and Electic Bass</td>
                <td>Loving spouse, 5 kids, and 5 close friends</td>
                <td>An intimate connection to a higher power</td>
                <td>A strong sense of my purpose and meaning in life</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Worst Self</td>
                <td>Weak and obese</td>
                <td>Only TV/movie trivia and a few words</td>
                <td>Amazon warehouse boxing and a few bass chords</td>
                <td>No spouse, no kids, no friends</td>
                <td>No relationship with any higher power</td>
                <td>A crippling sense of meaninglessness in my life</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <br>Next, in each area of your life, write one goal that would help you be your Best Self. 
        <br>Then, break these goals down into small, achievable milestones.
        <br>Finally, design your daily routines that will help you regularly achieve these milestones, and eventually, your larger goals. </p>
